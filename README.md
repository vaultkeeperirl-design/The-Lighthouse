# The Lighthouse: A Creative Writing Project

## Overview
"The Lighthouse" is a surreal mystery series following the misadventures of **Eddie Holloway**, a failed police recruit turned "private investigator" who inherits a mysterious lighthouse on the wild coast of Victoria, Australia.

The story blends the gritty, cynical humor of *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia* with the atmospheric dread of *Twin Peaks* and the whimsical, multidimensional mystery of *Gravity Falls*.

## Premise
Eddie Holloway failed the police entrance exam—twice. Not because he wasn't "smart" (his words), but because he "didn't play by their rules." Now, he runs "Holloway Investigations," a private investigation firm that mostly consists of him snooping through his neighbors' bins and charging people for "protection" they didn't ask for.

When his estranged great-uncle dies and leaves him "The Sentinel," an old, crumbling lighthouse on a limestone stack off the coast of Victoria, Eddie sees it as the perfect headquarters. But the lighthouse holds a secret: its ancient brass elevator doesn't just go up to the light—it goes to *other realms*.

## Setting: Port Whisper, Victoria, Australia
Located along the rugged Shipwreck Coast, Port Whisper is a small, damp town where the wind always sounds like a secret. The lighthouse sits on a jagged stack reachable only by a narrow, treacherous stone bridge that floods at high tide.

## Main Characters
- **Eddie "Hustle" Holloway**: A self-proclaimed "detective" with a chip on his shoulder and a complete lack of self-awareness. He's convinced he's the next Sherlock Holmes, but he's more of a delusional grifter.
- **The "Elevator"**: A sentient (or seemingly so) brass cage that transports its passengers to bizarre dimensions based on the floor selected—and sometimes on its own whims.
