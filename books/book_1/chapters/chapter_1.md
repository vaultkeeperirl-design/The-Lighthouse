# Chapter 1: The Eviction

The sign on the door of the shipping container said *HOLLOWAY INVESTIGATIONS: DISCRETION GUARANTEED*. It was written in Sharpie on a piece of cardboard that had been taped over the "Sea-Land" logo.

Eddie Holloway sat inside, sweating. It was forty degrees in the industrial park, and the container was essentially a giant oven designed to bake whatever hope he had left. He was currently staring at a cold meat pie and a stack of unpaid bills that he liked to refer to as "pending litigation."

"Eddie! Open the bloody door!"

The voice belonged to Barry, the site manager. Barry was a man who smelled of diesel and disappointment, and he had been trying to evict Eddie for three weeks.

Eddie sighed, wiped a bead of sweat from his forehead, and stood up. He adjusted his suit jacket—a charcoal number he’d picked up at a Salvos in Geelong—and checked his reflection in the back of a polished spoon. He looked like a man who had seen things. Mostly the inside of a kebab shop at 3 AM, but things nonetheless.

He kicked the door open.

"Barry! My man!" Eddie grinned, throwing his arms out. "I was just about to come find you. I’ve got some very exciting news regarding the arrears."

Barry stood there, arms crossed, flanked by two guys who looked like they’d been built out of old bricks. "The only news I want, Eddie, is that you’re gone. Your 'office' is a health hazard, and you haven't paid the site fee since the Queen died."

"Technically, the contract was with the Crown, Barry. There’s a legal grey area when there’s a transition of power. My lawyers—"

"You don't have lawyers, Eddie. You have a prepaid SIM card and a stack of 'Better Call Saul' DVDs." Barry stepped forward, poking Eddie in the chest. "Move your shit. Now. Or we’re welding the door shut with you inside."

Eddie’s grin didn’t falter, though his left eye gave a slight, involuntary twitch. "Right. Total lack of respect for the private sector. I see how it is. Fine. I was actually looking for an excuse to move to my secondary headquarters anyway. This place is… it’s a bit too 'urban' for my new clientele."

"Your 'clientele' is the guy who sells stolen catalytic converters in the back alley," Barry deadpanned.

As Eddie began tossing his worldly possessions—a box of files (mostly takeaway menus), a foldable chair, and a decorative katana—into the back of his rusty Holden Commodore, a silver Mercedes pulled up to the gate of the industrial park.

A man in a suit that cost more than Eddie’s entire life stepped out. He looked around with an expression of profound disgust, like he’d accidentally stepped in something organic.

"Edward Holloway?" the man asked, holding up a clipboard.

Eddie froze. His first instinct was to run. Usually, men in suits meant debt collectors, or worse, the tax office. "Who’s asking? If it’s about the incident at the AFL Grand Final, I’ve already apologized to the mascot."

"I’m from Henderson & Finch," the man said, his voice as dry as a sun-bleached bone. "I’m here regarding the estate of your late great-uncle, Bartholomew Holloway."

Eddie paused, a half-eaten meat pie in one hand and a magnifying glass in the other. "Uncle Bart? The one who lived in the lighthouse and yelled at the moon?"

"The same," the lawyer said. "He’s passed away. And according to his will, you are the sole beneficiary."

Eddie’s eyes widened. He looked at Barry, then at his shipping container, then at the lawyer.

"A lighthouse?" Eddie whispered. "Like… a big stone tower where I can't be bothered by site managers?"

"It’s called The Sentinel," the lawyer replied. "In Port Whisper."

Eddie dropped the meat pie. "Barry, forget what I said about the arrears. Keep the container. I’m moving to the coast. I’m going to be a man of mystery."

He hopped into the Commodore, the engine coughing a cloud of blue smoke into Barry’s face. As he sped out of the industrial park, Eddie felt a surge of something he hadn't felt in years: an opportunity to scam a completely new group of people.

"Port Whisper," he muttered, checking his GPS. "Get ready for Holloway Investigations. The tide is coming in."
