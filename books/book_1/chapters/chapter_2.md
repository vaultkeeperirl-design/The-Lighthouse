# Chapter 2: The Gateway to Nowhere

The drive to Port Whisper took four hours, most of which Eddie spent shouting at his car’s radio and trying to convince himself that he was a "maritime strategist."

By the time the Commodore crested the final hill, the sun was dipping below the horizon, painting the Southern Ocean in shades of bruised purple and angry orange. Below him lay Port Whisper. It wasn't so much a town as it was a collection of buildings that had given up on life. A few dozen houses clung to the cliffs, their paint stripped by decades of salt air, and a single main street led down to a harbor where three battered fishing boats bobbed in the swell.

And there it was. Out in the water, sitting on a pillar of limestone that looked like a giant’s rotten tooth, was The Sentinel. It was a tall, imposing needle of white stone, topped with a glass gallery that caught the last of the light like a dying eye.

"Beautiful," Eddie said, then winced as a piece of his car’s trim fell off. "And probably tax-deductible."

He drove down into the town, his engine rattling like a bag of spanners. He needed information, and in a town like this, information only flowed in one direction: through the pub.

*The Sinking Anchor* was a squat, windowless building that smelled of damp dog and cheap tobacco. Eddie pushed the door open and stepped inside. The room went silent. Twelve men in high-vis jackets and woolly beanies turned as one to stare at him.

Eddie straightened his suit jacket. "Evening, gentlemen. I’m Edward Holloway. You might have heard of me. I’m the new owner of the lighthouse."

A man at the bar, whose face looked like a topographic map of the local reef, squinted at him. "Holloway? You’re Bart’s boy?"

"Great-nephew," Eddie corrected, sliding onto a stool. "And a professional private investigator. I’ll be setting up my firm out at the Sentinel. If anyone’s missing a cow or thinks their wife is cheating with the postman, I’m your man. First consultation is fifty bucks, plus expenses."

The barman, a massive individual named Groggy (presumably not his birth name), leaned over the counter. "You’re going to live at the Sentinel? Alone?"

"Me and my sharp wits, Groggy. And maybe a mini-fridge."

The locals exchanged looks. Some were skeptical; others looked like they were mentally preparing a eulogy.

"The bridge is out," Groggy said. "High tide. You aren't getting across until midnight."

"Is that so?" Eddie said, trying to look undeterred. "Well then, I suppose I’ll have a beer. A cold one. And none of that craft rubbish. Give me whatever you give the people you don't like."

"That'd be the VB," Groggy grunted, pulling a tap.

Eddie spent the next three hours trying to "embed himself in the local culture." By "embed," he meant telling increasingly tall tales about his time as a "special consultant for the Melbourne Homicide Squad" (which was actually a week spent as a witness in a traffic court).

"The thing about crime," Eddie said, gesturing wildly with a half-empty glass, "is that it's all about the *vibe*. You have to think like a criminal. And I’ve got a very criminal mind. Ask anyone in the Western Suburbs."

"We believe you," said one of the locals, a man with one eye and a very suspicious-looking scar. "But you might want to watch yourself at the Sentinel. Bart wasn't right in the head. He used to talk to the elevator."

Eddie laughed, a loud, forced sound. "Talk to an elevator! The man was a loon. Probably just lonely. Me? I’m a man of science. I’m a man of logic. An elevator is just a box that goes up and down. It’s physics."

"Right," the local said, looking back at his drink. "Physics. Good luck with that."

At midnight, the tide finally receded. Eddie stumbled out of the pub, his head spinning slightly from the three VBs and the overwhelming smell of fish. He drove the Commodore down to the water’s edge, where a narrow stone bridge emerged from the foam like the spine of a sea serpent.

He looked up at the lighthouse. It was dark now, silhouetted against a sky filled with more stars than he’d ever seen in the city. The wind howled through the limestone stacks, a sound that almost—if you were drunk enough—sounded like someone whispering your name.

"Holloway Investigations," Eddie muttered, putting the car in gear. "We’re going up in the world."

The Commodore’s headlights cut through the mist as he began the slow, bumpy crawl across the bridge. The ocean crashed on either side, spraying salt onto his windshield. He felt small. He felt exposed. But most of all, he felt like he was finally going to get away with something big.
