# Chapter 3: The Sentinel

The stone bridge ended at a heavy iron door set directly into the base of the limestone stack. Eddie climbed out of the Commodore, his legs feeling like jelly. The wind here was a physical force, trying to shove him into the sea.

"Great-Uncle Bart," Eddie shouted over the gale, "you were a psychopath for living here!"

He fumbled with the heavy brass key the lawyer had given him. It was cold and felt strangely heavy, as if it were made of something denser than metal. He jammed it into the lock and turned. With a groan that sounded like a dying whale, the door swung inward.

Eddie stepped inside and clicked on his flashlight.

The air inside the base of the lighthouse was still and bone-chilly. It smelled of ancient dust, salt, and something oddly sweet—like rotting jasmine. The walls were thick, carved directly into the rock of the stack. A spiral staircase wound upward into the darkness, but Eddie’s eyes were immediately drawn to the center of the room.

There it was. The elevator.

It was a cage of tarnished brass, decorated with intricate filigree that looked like intertwining vines or maybe tentacles. The glass panels were etched with scenes of ships being tossed on stormy seas. It looked like it belonged in a Victorian hotel, or a nightmare.

"Look at this," Eddie whispered, his breath fogging in the cold air. "I could probably sell the brass for a fortune if the detective thing doesn't pan out."

He walked around it. There was no cable going up. No pulleys. No motor. Just the cage sitting in the middle of a stone shaft.

He pushed the gate. It slid open with a musical chime.

Eddie stepped inside. The floor of the elevator was covered in a thick, red carpet that looked brand new, which was odd considering the rest of the lighthouse was covered in a layer of grime.

On the wall was a control panel. It was a chaotic mess of buttons. There were the usual numbers—1 through 10—but then there were buttons with symbols. A crescent moon. A jagged bolt of lightning. A small, perfectly rendered drawing of a fried egg.

"Bart, you old drunk," Eddie chuckled. "Custom buttons. Fancy."

He decided he wanted to see the top. The "CEO's office," as he’d already started calling the lantern room. He reached out and pressed the button for floor 10.

Nothing happened. No hum of a motor, no lurch of movement.

"Piece of junk," Eddie muttered. "I’ll have to sue the estate for a refund."

He went to step out of the cage, but the door slammed shut on its own. The chime rang again, this time a deeper, more resonant note that vibrated in Eddie’s teeth.

Then, the elevator didn't go up. It didn't go down. It felt like the entire world just… shifted.

For a second, Eddie felt like he was being squeezed through a straw. His vision blurred, colors bleeding together into a muddy grey. Then, with a soft *ding*, the movement stopped.

The doors slid open.

Eddie blinked. He wasn't at the top of the lighthouse. He wasn't even in the base anymore.

The elevator had opened onto a balcony. But beyond the balcony, there was no ocean. There was no Port Whisper.

There was a forest. But the trees were made of shimmering, translucent glass, and the sky above was a deep, vibrant crimson. Massive, bioluminescent jellyfish drifted through the air like clouds, trailing long, glowing tentacles that brushed against the treetops.

"Oh," Eddie said, his voice cracking. "Oh, that’s not Victoria."

He looked back at the elevator panel. The button he had pressed wasn't '10'. In the dim light, he realized it was a '0', but the circle was slightly broken at the top. It looked like a mouth.

"I think I might be in over my head," he whispered.

A large, purple crow with three eyes landed on the balcony railing. It looked at Eddie, then at his suit jacket.

"Nice suit," the crow said in a voice that sounded like gravel in a blender. "Salvos?"

Eddie stared at the bird. Then he did the only logical thing a professional private investigator would do in this situation.

He pressed every single button on the panel at once.
