# Chapter 4: The Interdimensional Commute

Eddie Holloway didn't scream. Screaming was for people who didn't have a solid grasp of the situation. Instead, he made a series of high-pitched, rhythmic wheezing sounds that he would later describe as "tactical breathing."

The elevator doors had closed on the Glass Forest, but the elevator didn't move *up*. It moved *sideways*—not through space, but through the very fabric of Eddie’s sanity.

*Ding.*

The doors slid open. Outside was a void of absolute darkness, save for a massive, glowing gear that slowly rotated in the distance. The sound was like a thousand grandfather clocks ticking in unison.

"Nope," Eddie wheezed, slamming the "Close Door" button. "Too metaphorical."

*Ding.*

The doors opened again. This time, the elevator was looking out over a 1950s-style diner. The patrons were all identical men in grey suits eating plates of glowing blue jelly. They all turned to look at Eddie.

"Lunch break?" Eddie squeaked. He hit the '1' button. "Ground floor! Take me to the dirt and the salt and the disappointment!"

The elevator groaned. It felt like the brass cage was being twisted by invisible hands. Eddie was thrown against the red carpet as the world outside the glass panels turned into a kaleidoscope of screaming colors. He saw a city made of bubbles, a sea of molten silver, and for a terrifying three seconds, he saw his own mother judging his life choices from the perspective of a fourth-dimensional being.

Finally, with a chime that sounded more like a sigh of relief, the elevator stopped.

The doors slid open. The smell of fish, damp limestone, and cheap Australian lager flooded in.

Eddie crawled out of the cage and kissed the cold, slimy floor of the Sentinel’s base. "Oxygen," he moaned. "Glorious, salt-filled, carcinogenic oxygen."

He stayed there for a long time, listening to the Southern Ocean roar against the stacks. The elevator stood silent behind him, its brass filigree glinting in the moonlight. It looked innocent now, like a piece of furniture in a posh hotel.

Eddie stood up, dusting off his suit. His hands were shaking, but his mind—the part of his mind that was constantly looking for an angle—was already working.

"Okay," he muttered, straightening his tie. "Okay, Eddie. So the old man wasn't crazy. He was just a... a travel agent for the apocalypse. This is good. This is an asset."

He looked at the control panel again. He remembered the '0' button—the Mouth. That had led to the Glass Forest. The 'Spiral' led to... somewhere else. He needed to map this. He needed to organize. He needed a system.

But mostly, he needed someone else to go in there first. Someone expendable. Someone who wouldn't ask too many questions and was physically incapable of understanding the concept of 'existential dread.'

He knew exactly who to call.
