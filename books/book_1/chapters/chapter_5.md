# Chapter 5: The Sidekick

Finding Baz was easy. You just had to go to the part of Port Whisper where the "Caution: Unstable Cliffs" signs had been ignored, and look for the man trying to use a microwave as a lobster trap.

Baz Thompson was currently standing on the edge of a jagged limestone ledge, holding a length of rusty wire and a half-eaten Chiko Roll.

"Baz!" Eddie shouted, leaning out the window of his Commodore. "Get over here! I’ve got a business proposition for you!"

Baz turned, his face lighting up with a grin that was missing at least three key players in the dental department. "Eddie! You're the guy from the pub! The city detective!"

"That’s right," Eddie said, stepping out of the car and trying to look like a man who owned at least one functioning bank account. "Holloway Investigations is expanding. I’ve reviewed your resume—well, I’ve heard you were fired for using explosives in a school zone—and I think you’ve got the 'disruptive energy' I’m looking for."

Baz hopped down from the ledge. "I was just trying to clear the kelp, Eddie. It’s a cloggage issue."

"I love the initiative," Eddie lied, putting an arm around Baz’s high-vis vest. "How would you like to be my Senior Tactical Consultant? The pay is... well, it’s mostly in 'equity' right now, but I can offer you a place to stay that isn't a tent, and all the meat pies you can 'acquire' from the general store."

Baz’s eyes widened. "A real job? Like in a movie?"

"Exactly like a movie," Eddie said. "Specifically, a movie where the hero has a very loyal and very quiet assistant who does all the heavy lifting. I’ve moved into the Sentinel. I need a man on the ground. A local who knows the 'vibe' of this town."

"The Sentinel?" Baz whispered, his voice dropping an octave. "My pop used to say that place was a portal to hell. He said Uncle Bart once pulled a three-legged goat out of the chimney that could speak Latin."

"Latin is a dead language, Baz. Don't worry about it," Eddie said, ushering him toward the Commodore. "It’s just an old building with a very fancy elevator. And I need you to help me... test its efficiency."

"Test it how?"

"Oh, you know," Eddie said, starting the car. "Just basic weight-bearing tests. Pushing buttons. Making sure the 'Other Side' doesn't have any unpaid parking tickets. Standard detective work."

As they drove toward the bridge, the sun began to set, casting long, twisted shadows across the Shipwreck Coast. Baz looked out at the ocean, his face full of simple, honest excitement.

Eddie looked at Baz and felt a twinge of something that might have been guilt, but was more likely just indigestion.

"One thing, Baz," Eddie said as they reached the bridge.

"Yeah, boss?"

"If the elevator asks you what your favorite color is... don't answer. It’s a trick."

"Got it," Baz said, nodding seriously. "Don't talk to the box. I’m a professional."
