# Book 1: The Sentinel's Grift - Outline

**Target Length:** 50,000+ words
**Premise:** Eddie Holloway inherits a lighthouse in Port Whisper and discovers it's a gateway to other realms. He tries to use this to his advantage while failing to solve a local mystery.

## Act 1: The New Headquarters
- **Chapter 1: The Eviction.** Eddie is forced out of his current "office" (a repurposed shipping container in a Melbourne industrial park). He receives a letter from a legal firm regarding his Great-Uncle Bartholomew’s estate.
- **Chapter 2: The Gateway to Nowhere.** Eddie drives his beat-up 2005 Holden Commodore to Port Whisper. He tries to "network" at the local pub, *The Sinking Anchor*, and immediately insults the town’s only mechanic.
- **Chapter 3: Crossing the Rubicon (at Low Tide).** Eddie makes the treacherous trek across the stone bridge to the Sentinel. He finds the place a wreck but falls in love with the "aesthetic."
- **Chapter 4: The Brass Cage.** Eddie explores the lighthouse and discovers the elevator. He presses a button with a symbol of a fish and ends up in a dimension that is just an endless, shallow ocean under a purple sky. He barely makes it back.

## Act 2: The Case of the Vanishing Kelpie
- **Chapter 5: Professional Services.** A young woman named Sarah arrives, desperate to find her missing dog, Bluey. Eddie accepts the case (and her last $50) despite having no idea what he's doing.
- **Chapter 6: Clues and Brews.** Eddie’s "investigation" involves him drinking at the pub and accidentally discovering that his Great-Uncle was hated by everyone in town.
- **Chapter 7: The Spiral Button.** Eddie uses the elevator again, hoping it will lead to a shortcut. He ends up in a "Noir Realm" where everything is black and white, and he has to outrun a sentient fog.
- **Chapter 8: The Connection.** Eddie finds Bluey’s collar snagged on the elevator’s brass cage. He realizes the dog might have slipped into another realm.

## Act 3: The Breach
- **Chapter 9: The Debt Collector.** A man from Eddie’s past (a loan shark named "Big Vinnie") tracks him to Port Whisper. Eddie has to hide him in the lighthouse.
- **Chapter 10: Realm-Hopping Chaos.** To lose Vinnie, Eddie drags him into the elevator. They jump through three different realms: a forest of giant mushrooms, a clockwork city, and a void where gravity is optional.
- **Chapter 11: The Truth about Uncle Bart.** Eddie finds his uncle's hidden journal in the lighthouse lantern room. Bart wasn't just a lighthouse keeper; he was a "Border Guard."
- **Chapter 12: The Rescue.** Eddie finds Bluey in the "Echo Realm"—a twisted version of Port Whisper. He also finds the thing that took Bluey.

## Act 4: The Final Stand
- **Chapter 13: The Bridge is Out.** A massive storm hits. The bridge is destroyed. Eddie, Vinnie, and the dog are trapped in the Sentinel while something from the Echo Realm tries to get in.
- **Chapter 14: The "Detective" at Work.** Eddie uses his "skills" (luck, cowardice, and a flare gun) to defend the lighthouse.
- **Chapter 15: Closing the Deal.** Eddie manages to trick the entity back into the elevator and sends it to the "Toaster Realm." Vinnie is so traumatized he flees the town as soon as the tide goes out.
- **Chapter 16: Open for Business.** Eddie returns the dog, keeps the money, and realizes he’s now the unofficial Border Guard. He puts up a sign: *Holloway Investigations - Interdimensional Experts.*
