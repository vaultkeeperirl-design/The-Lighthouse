# Barry "Baz" Thompson

**Role:** Sidekick / "The Muscle" (loosely defined)
**Occupation:** Professional Unemployed Person / Ex-Bait Shop Employee
**Age:** 31

## Background
Baz has lived in Port Whisper his entire life. He’s the kind of guy who knows where everyone keeps their spare keys and which bins have the best discarded electronics. He was fired from the local bait shop for trying to "innovate" the fishing industry by using fireworks as bait.

## Personality
- **Blindly Loyal**: He thinks Eddie is a "city genius" because Eddie wears a suit and uses words like "litigation."
- **Fearless (due to lack of imagination)**: He isn't scared of the interdimensional monsters; he mostly just wants to know if they can be deep-fried.
- **Resourceful**: He can fix almost anything with duct tape and a "can-do" attitude, though it will probably explode later.

## Dynamic with Eddie
Baz is the "Charlie" to Eddie’s "Dennis/Frank." He does the dirty work and comes up with the most insane "innovations" for Eddie’s schemes. He believes in the "Holloway Investigations" brand more than Eddie does.

## Appearance
Wears a dirty high-vis vest over a "Metallica" shirt that has seen better decades. Always has a pair of pliers hanging from his belt.
