# Eddie "Hustle" Holloway

**Role:** Protagonist / "Detective" / Absolute Disaster
**Occupation:** Founder of Holloway Investigations (formerly failed police recruit)
**Age:** 34

## Background
Eddie grew up in a working-class suburb of Melbourne, always looking for the "easy way" that ended up being much harder. He failed the Victorian Police entrance exam because he tried to "negotiate" the answers with the examiner and was caught trying to bribe his way out of the physical fitness test with a voucher for a kebab shop.

## Personality
Eddie is a "piece of shit" in the vein of the *Always Sunny* cast. He is:
- **Highly Delusional**: Thinks he’s a brilliant tactician.
- **Morally Flexible**: Will betray anyone for twenty bucks and a meat pie.
- **Resilient**: No matter how many times he’s beaten down, he bounces back with a new, worse plan.
- **Australian to the Bone**: Heavy use of slang, skeptical of authority (despite wanting to be it), and a deep love for cheap beer.

## Goal
To use the "Sentinel" lighthouse as a base for his PI firm to avoid paying rent in the city, and eventually to monetize the "weird elevator shit" he discovers.

## Appearance
Usually wears a cheap, wrinkled suit jacket over a stained T-shirt, and "tactical" cargo pants. He carries a magnifying glass that he doesn't know how to use properly.
