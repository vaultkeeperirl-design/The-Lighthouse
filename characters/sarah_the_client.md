# Sarah "The Client" Jenkins

**Role:** The Client / Potential Antagonist
**Occupation:** Local Vet Tech (unemployed) / Part-time "Finder of Things"
**Age:** 29

## Background
Sarah grew up in Port Whisper. Her father, a disgraced academic, was the only person who could stand being in a room with Great-Uncle Bart for more than ten minutes. When her father died, he left her a key—a key that Bart told her was the "most important thing in the world." She kept it on her dog Bluey’s collar because "no one would ever steal from a Kelpie."

## Personality
- **Anxious**: Constantly on edge, likely due to the fact that she knows more about the lighthouse than she lets on.
- **Skeptical**: She thinks Eddie is an idiot, but he’s the only one with the key to the Sentinel.
- **Goal-Oriented**: She doesn't care about the dimensions; she just wants the "Safety Deposit Box" her father promised her.

## Dynamic with Eddie
She treats Eddie like a particularly stupid child. She is the "Straight Man" to his chaos, but she has her own secrets that make her just as dangerous.
