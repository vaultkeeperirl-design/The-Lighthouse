# The Lighthouse Lore Bible

## The Sentinel & The Elevator
The Sentinel is not just a lighthouse; it is a "Linchpin." It sits on a thin spot between dimensions. The elevator is the needle that threads through those dimensions.

### Mechanics of the Elevator
- **The Chime**: A musical note that sounds whenever the elevator "shifts." The pitch of the note indicates how "far" the destination is from reality.
- **The Shift**: Passengers experience a physical sensation of being compressed or stretched. It is often accompanied by the smell of ozone, damp wool, or burnt toast.
- **The Buttons**:
    - **Numbered (1-10)**: Standard lighthouse floors, though they often "bleed" into other realms if the lighthouse is unstable.
    - **The Spiral**: The Noir Realm (A high-contrast, archetypal detective world).
    - **The Mouth (0)**: The Glass Forest (A crystalline ecosystem).
    - **The Eye**: The Echo Realm (A distorted, horrifying reflection of the current location).
    - **The Slice of Toast**: The "Buffer" Realm (A strangely domestic, safe space that looks like a 1970s kitchen).

### The Border Guard
For centuries, a lineage of "Guards" has inhabited the Sentinel. Their job is to ensure that "nothing comes in, and nothing goes out" that shouldn't.
- **Bartholomew Holloway**: Eddie’s great-uncle. He was the last Guard. He died under mysterious circumstances, but locals claim he was "pulling things out of the elevator" that he should have left alone.
- **The Pact**: An ancient agreement between the Guards and the "Entities" of the Between to keep the realms separated.

## Known Realms
1. **The Glass Forest**: Trees of translucent glass, crimson sky, aerial jellyfish. The flora is sharp and fragile.
2. **The Noir Realm**: Black and white, perpetual night, governed by the "Logic of the Detective." One must speak in monologues to be understood.
3. **The Echo Realm**: A "negative" of Port Whisper. The ocean is made of ink, and the lighthouse is a jagged skeleton of iron.
4. **The Void**: A place of zero gravity and absolute silence. Used as a "shortcut" between distant realms.
5. **The Clockwork City**: An infinite landscape of gears and brass machinery. Inhabited by "The Ticking Men."

## Key Entities
- **The Three-Eyed Crow**: A resident of the Glass Forest. It speaks in riddles and is obsessed with human fashion.
- **The Collector**: A being that exists in the "Between." It "collects" things (and people) that fall through the cracks of reality.
- **The Border Board**: A spectral group of previous Guards who sometimes offer advice—usually in the form of cryptic insults.
