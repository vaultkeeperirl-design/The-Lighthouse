# The Sentinel (The Lighthouse)

**Location:** Off the coast of Port Whisper, Victoria.
**Status:** Ancient, damp, and definitely haunted (or worse).

## Description
The Sentinel is a 19th-century lighthouse built from local limestone. It stands on a natural pillar of rock (a "stack") separated from the mainland by fifty meters of churning, shark-infested Southern Ocean. A narrow, crumbling stone bridge connects it to the shore, but it's only passable for a few hours a day.

## The Elevator
The core of the mystery. The lighthouse has a central elevator made of tarnished brass and etched glass.
- **The Panel**: There are more buttons than there are floors in the building. Some are numbered, others have strange symbols (a spiral, an eye, a slice of toast).
- **The Mechanics**: It shouldn't work. There's no visible engine or cable. When it moves, the air smells like ozone and damp wool.
- **The Destination**: While it can take you to the light gallery or the basement, pressing the "wrong" button sends the elevator into the "Between." When the doors open, you aren't in the lighthouse anymore.

## The Basement
Eddie’s "office." It’s cold, smells like dead fish, and is filled with his great-uncle's old nautical junk—and a few things that don't look like they belong on Earth.
