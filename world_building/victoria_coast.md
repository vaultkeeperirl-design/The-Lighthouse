# The Shipwreck Coast (Setting)

**Location:** Port Whisper, Victoria, Australia.

## Atmosphere
The coast of Victoria is beautiful but treacherous. Massive limestone cliffs drop into a grey, violent ocean. The wind is constant, a howling gale that carries the salt spray kilometers inland.

## Port Whisper
A dying fishing village that’s too far from the Great Ocean Road to get any decent tourists.
- **The Pub (The Sinking Anchor)**: The town's social hub. It’s dark, the beer is always slightly warm, and the locals are suspicious of anyone who doesn't have at least one family member buried in the local cemetery.
- **The Locals**: They know the lighthouse is "weird," but they don't talk about it. They mostly just think Eddie is a "city wanker" who's going to fall off the bridge and drown.

## Key Features
- **The Twelve Apostles (Nearby)**: Famous limestone stacks. The locals claim there used to be thirteen, but "something" took the last one.
- **Shipwrecks**: The seabed is littered with the skeletons of 19th-century ships. Sometimes, after a big storm, things from those ships wash up on the beach. Things that shouldn't still be intact.
